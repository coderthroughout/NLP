## Introduction

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. This repository houses various NLP projects, each designed to explore different aspects of language processing and provide hands-on experience with NLP techniques. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced practitioner, you'll find valuable resources and examples here.

## Projects

This repository includes the following NLP projects:

1.  **Text Summarization:**
    -   A project that uses NLP techniques to automatically generate concise summaries of text documents.
    -   Includes implementations using extractive and abstractive summarization methods.
    -   Location: `text_summarization/`

2.  **Sentiment Analysis:**
    -   A project that analyzes the sentiment of text data (e.g., reviews, social media posts).
    -   Utilizes machine learning models and lexicon-based approaches.
    -   Location: `sentiment_analysis/`

3.  **Named Entity Recognition (NER):**
    -   A project that identifies and classifies named entities in text (e.g., persons, organizations, locations).
    -   Employs techniques like spaCy and transformer-based models.
    -   Location: `named_entity_recognition/`

4.  **Text Classification:**
    -   A project that classifies text documents into predefined categories.
    -   Includes implementations using various machine learning algorithms.
    -   Location: `text_classification/`

5.  **Language Translation:**
    -   A project that translates text from one language to another.
    -   Leverages transformer models like those in the Hugging Face Transformers library.
    -   Location: `language_translation/`

6. **Topic Modeling:**
    - Project that uses algorithms like LDA(Latent Dirichlet Allocation) to discover abstract topics that occur in a collection of documents.
    - Location: `topic_modeling/`

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/coderthroughout/NLP.git](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/coderthroughout/NLP.git)
    cd NLP
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Navigate to the specific project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd text_summarization/  # or any other project directory
    ```

## Usage

Each project directory contains a `README.md` file with specific instructions on how to run and use the project. In general, you can run the main script using:

```bash
python main.py  # or the relevant script name
